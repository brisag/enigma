# enigma
Project Reflections

## Summary
We built Cesar Cipher in a computer program.  This program can take incoming text and either encode it or decode it.  It can do so by utilizing shifts from the keys and offsets.  Our Cipher is intricate.  It is even able to encrypt without a key or a date.  

## Overall 
I loved this experience. I think I prefer to work alone based of this expereince, but due to the nature of not asking for help from classmates or mentors, it was difficult to bounce ideas and debug if I was unsure of how to proceed. To make sure I understood the project, I did a lot of diagraming for each class I built. I broke things down to the smallest of units possible.  
This means that I have many more classes, but it allows me to encapsulate my thoughts and make sure everything was working.  

## Technical 
I struggled with a lot of errors when it came time to build my enigma class.  I was unsure of how to piece multiple classes together.  Things would work, but as I tried to add generated keys and numbers, my code would break.  Ultimately, I got it down as clean as possible and working.   The command line, though it works, I am not confident that it is the best way to create it.  Additionally, I relied heavily on APIDoc and RubyDocs for arrays and functions that I never considered to apply to this project.  

## Reflection
I worked hard on all the tests and classes.  However, I procrastinated on the command line because I thought it would be easy.  It was the hardest one, and I spent hours, unable to ask for advice (because the world was sleeping), solving a problem that not even Overstack can solve. My handle was nil, and I couldn't not convert it to string.  After googling endlessly, I found that eval band makes things into a string.  I learned to finish a day earlier, to clean up my coding mess! I feel more confident in coding.  I have this approach of following patterns for the ICs, but this forces me to think differently.

## Functionality 
Meets Expectations 2.5-3
I did everything except Cracking.  
## OOP 
Meets Expectations 3
I put 2 modules in.  Very organized.  Methods are not long. 
## Conventions & Mechanics
Meets Expectations 3
Well written and follows format and syntax.  hound was not working on my file unfortuantely.  I deleted WIP enigma and I lost hound since I used the same name.  
## TDD. 
Above expectations.  3.5
I followed TDD and had exceptional version control.  I utilized commits and many branches.  I was shy of 100% coverage.  Additionally I used Mocks and Stubs for dates.
